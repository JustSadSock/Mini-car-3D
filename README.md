# Mini-car-3D

## Setup
1. Install dependencies (required for physics):
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   If `@dimforge/rapier3d-compat` is missing, the server will log a clear message and refuse to start multiplayer until you install.
2. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in one or more browser tabs to drive.
